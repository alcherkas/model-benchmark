# Resume Page Specification

## Overview

A personal portfolio/resume page for a Solutions Architect, designed with a futuristic aesthetic featuring animated elements. The page will be hosted as a GitHub Page.

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Theme: Futuristic & Professional

- **Color Palette**: Dark background with neon accent colors (cyan, electric blue, purple gradients)
- **Typography**: Clean, modern sans-serif fonts with subtle glow effects on headings
- **Layout**: Asymmetric grid with floating card elements
- **Depth**: Layered design with glassmorphism effects (frosted glass panels)

### Animation Principles

- Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance rather than distract
- Performance-conscious - smooth 60fps animations
- Reduced motion support for accessibility

---

## Page Sections

- Call-to-action for collaboration

**Animations:**
- Glowing button effects
- Icon hover animations
- Form field focus animations (if contact form included)

---

## Interactive Elements

### Navigation
- Fixed/sticky header with blur effect
- Smooth scroll to sections
- Active section indicator with animated underline

### Cursor Effects (Optional)
- Custom cursor with trailing particles
- Magnetic effect on interactive elements

### Scroll Interactions
- Progress indicator
- Section transitions with fade/slide effects
- Parallax layers at different scroll speeds

---

## Animated Background Elements

### Primary Background
- Gradient mesh that slowly shifts colors
- Floating geometric shapes (triangles, hexagons, circles)
- Grid lines with perspective (cyber/tron aesthetic)

### Accent Elements
- Particle system creating constellation effect
- Subtle noise texture overlay
- Scanline effect (very subtle)

---

## Responsive Behavior

### Desktop (1200px+)
- Full animations enabled
- Multi-column layouts
- Large interactive elements

### Tablet (768px - 1199px)
- Simplified animations
- Two-column layouts where appropriate
- Touch-friendly interactions

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Minimal animations (performance)
- Single column layout
- Hamburger navigation
- Tap interactions instead of hover

---

## Accessibility Requirements

- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Sufficient color contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly content structure
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements

---

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy load animations as sections enter viewport
- Use hardware-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
- Optimize images and assets
- Minimize layout shifts during animations
- Target 60fps for all animations

---

## Content Tone

- Professional but approachable
- Confident without being boastful
- Technical depth with accessible explanations
- Forward-thinking and innovative

---

## Key Messaging Hierarchy

1. **Primary**: Solutions Architect with deep .NET and AWS expertise
2. **Secondary**: Strategic thinker (DDD, Wardley Mapping, Team Topologies)
3. **Tertiary**: AI innovation leader (development, migration, adoption)

---

## Success Metrics

- Fast initial load time
- Smooth scrolling and animations
- Clear communication of expertise areas
- Professional impression that stands out
- Easy to navigate and find information
